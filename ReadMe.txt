The Assignment:

When we discuss merge sort and the abstract data types for polynomials and sparse matrices, we find out that there are some similarities between the merge procedure in the merge sort and the procedures to compute polynomial addition and matrix multiplication. 

For instance, we have two lists that are combined into one in all the cases. In the procedure to combine two lists, we have pointers, one for each list to keep in mind what has/hasn¡¦t included in the combined list and the pointers are moving to the same direction until all the list items are exhausted. Write a code to realize such observation.
